# SelfBuild
## Introduction
This is my try to build my own simple database which is based on db_tutorial
## Setup
First, you need to clone this project into your Linux machine because my programme is written and run on the Linux operating system.
```
git clone https://github.com/KuangjuX/Self-Database.git
cd Self-Database/database
```
In this project, I provide a Makefile file , hoping to help our database programme compile and run easily.
So you can compile and run by executing the following commands in your terminal:
```
make
make run
```
And if you want to compile the programme again:, you can execute `make clean` to delete exist executable file.
